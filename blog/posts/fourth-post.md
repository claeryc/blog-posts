# AI is becoming inbred
My prediction of changes in **artificial inteligence**.

If an AI image generator (LLM) is repeatedly being fed with the same information,
it will learn from its own output which is being used as new input.
The negative outcome comes to show, after just a couple of Generations
(multiple attempts of using the model's output as input).
The known hallucinations which are still present in current AI-models
will eventually multiply and create obscure images,
which often differ a lot from the original image 
("inbred", a degenerative learning process).

The procedure would be played out as follows:
The user uses a prompt which lets the AI-model (i.e. ChatGPT) to create an image:
Text input: "create an image of Mona Lisa"
-  image is being created (Mona Lisa)
Text input: "describe the image"
- model describes the image (derives a bit from the original)
Text input: "create an image which looks like this:"
- user inserts the generated description in their own prompt
- model creates an image which looks different from the original version

If this process is being repeated enough times, it suddenly comes up
with something entirely different (in this example, a god surrounded by galaxies).
It is being speculated that with enough ai-generated images being uploaded to the internet,
the models might produce worse quality images (as well as texts, among other things) over time.

This has already been apparent throughout the introduction of earlier LLMs,
such as the Microsoft Chatbot on X (formerly known as Twitter), named [Tay.ai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay(chatbot)),
which Microsoft published an open [apology letter](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2016/03/25/learning-tays-introduction/) for.
On a side-note, this hasn't been Microsoft's first ai-chatbot.
The first one made an [appearance in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaoice), called [XiaoIce](https://news.microsoft.com/apac/features/much-more-than-a-chatbot-chinas-xiaoice-mixes-ai-with-emotions-and-wins-over-millions-of-fans/), which was used by 40 million people.

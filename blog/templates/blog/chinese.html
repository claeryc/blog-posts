    <p>
      Have you ever wanted to challenge your view on culture and society, or step outside your comfort zone? 
      Deciding to learn Chinese did just that for me—let me explain how and what I mean by this.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      By learning a new language, you not only acquire the skill to read and speak it, but you also become 
      more immersed in the culture in which it is spoken. Being aware of this can make the entire process 
      more fun and fulfilling.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The main factor that accounts for being consistent with learning and turning it into a habit is 
      <strong>motivation</strong>. However, there isn’t just one blueprint to follow in order to reach it—it 
      heavily relies on personal circumstances and preferences. You have to ask yourself: what’s the reason 
      for wanting to learn <em>this</em> language?
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Is it just pure boredom?</li>
      <li>Do I want to travel to another country?</li>
      <li>Do I have friends or family who speak that language?</li>
      <li>Do I want to challenge my worldview and be open to new experiences?</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      The last factor was my personal reason. Depending on what <em>your</em> reason might be, it can 
      significantly impact your motivation and the time required to study and reach your personally set goals.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Below, I’ll lay out how exactly I started, what resources I used, what my progress looks like, and what 
      I have learned throughout my studies—starting from using simple apps, all the way to living in China 
      and studying in one of the most populated cities.

    <h1 class="hero-text">Learning Resources</h1>
    <p>Here are my favorite resources for languge learning.</p>
    {% include "blog/lang_resources.html" %}
    <br>
    <p>Regadless of the Rank that I gave these methods, don't think that ones I ranked lower, or haven't mentioned are not worth picking up.</p>
    <p>In fact, all of these have been equally helpful to me throughout my language learning journey so far. The list just represents what is currently the most useful to me and is subject to change later on, which is why I might update the ranking in the future.</p>
    <p>Here I will briefly break down the reasoning for the choices I've made:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If starting out learning Chinese, or another language, without being exposed to it before, I believe that Duolingo might be a good choice for a lot of people to provide them a surface level, yet fun way of being briefly introduced to it.</li>
        <li>If one wants to learn Chinese inparticular, I think that HelloChinese is a better alternative to the previously mentioned app, as it entirely focuses on Mandarin and provides better and a greater variety of material.</li>
        <li>Most importantly is to apply the learned material by reinforcement. That can be done by writing, speaking or in other ways. One way could be by talking to other language learners, or better yet, native speakers. (I will go into more details later)</li>
    </ul>

        </div>
        <p>I arrived in China on February 2nd, marking my third visit to the country.</p>
        <p>Traveling in China can be quite challenging for foreigners who come unprepared. Fortunately, having already visited twice before, I was able to focus entirely on exploring the city, Nanjing.</p>
        <p>Before moving into my dorm, I had a couple of weeks to myself. During this time, I explored the campus area and tried out the nearby food options on my own, as I hadn’t yet met my fellow classmates.</p>
        <p>The weather was still cold, and the days were short. Luckily, my arrival coincided with the Lantern Festival. Seeing the old town district illuminated with countless glowing lanterns was a truly mesmerizing experience. <span style="font-style: italic;">(I will cover more about the first month in an upcoming blog post)</span></p>

            <h4>First Language Classes</h4>
            <span class="progress-date">February 24, 2025</span>
        </div>
        <p>Having classes in China is quite a unique experience for someone coming from Europe...</p>
        <p>The first week of classes acted as an orientation week to find the right difficulty for us. We were able to sit down and participate and switch to a higher or lower level if we so please.</p>
        <p>Already having learned Chinese before made me quite confident in picking the higher Elementary level and even played with the idea of choosing the lower Intermediate class. Well, this was before I actually took any classes.</p>
        <p>It turned out that I was overconfident in my capabilities since the classes and content were much more difficult than initially anticipated, which is why I settled for the higher Elementary course.</p>
        <p>I was able to understand a lot of the words, but the difficulty quickly ramped up in the coming weeks, as the main teacher only spoke Mandarin and didn't use any English to explain new concepts. That proved to be quite the challenge for me and my classmates.</p>

            <h4>First Impressions</h4>
            <span class="progress-date">March 01, 2025</span>
        </div>
        <p>There were still a few things I hadn’t experienced during my first two visits to China.</p>
        <p>This time, instead of sightseeing, I focused on living as I normally would back home. That way, it was easier to notice the direct differences in everyday life.</p>
        <p>One clear example is the subway and train system. To enter the subway, passengers must first purchase a ticket or pay with a QR code or NFC — it’s impossible to pass the security checkpoint without doing so. At most checkpoints, security requires passengers to hand over their water bottles for scanning, and sometimes they even ask you to take a sip before passing through. Bags must also be scanned, with their contents displayed on a monitor for inspection.</p>
        <p>The process at train stations is very similar, with the main difference being the need to present a passport. It gets scanned twice to ensure proper identity verification.</p>
        <p>While the procedure may seem strict at first, it actually makes traveling feel much safer, and the entire process only takes a few seconds.</p>

        </div>
        <p>It was bound to happen sooner or later — my first night out in the city.</p>
        <p>Before heading out for drinks with my German classmate, I met up with Masha, my Russian friend.</p>
        <p>We were both craving something sweet, so we decided to make pancakes together. We had originally planned to invite our friend Luis, but since he was busy that day, we postponed our plans with him. Masha was already familiar with the dormitory kitchen, so she took charge of the cooking while I went to the nearest supermarket to buy the ingredients.</p>
        <p>By the time we finished, it was already evening, and I had just enough time to head out and meet my other friend for a couple of drinks.</p>

        <p>I wanted to challenge myself by reading a Chinese book. Unfortunately, the book I bought turned out to be written in Cantonese rather than Mandarin.</p>
        <p>Although Cantonese and Mandarin share many similarities, their grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation differ significantly. This made it nearly impossible for me to read even a single line of the book.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>“To give” in Cantonese:</strong> 畀 (bei2) — a word closer to the ancient Chinese term for “give.”</li>
          <li><strong>“To give” in Mandarin:</strong> 给 (gěi) — the modern term commonly used in Mandarin.</li>

        <p>All good things eventually come to an end.</p>
        <p>During the first few weeks, many new friendships formed, one of them with our witty and humorous friend from the UK.</p>
        <p>We were surprised when he suddenly announced his decision to change plans, travel to America, and take part in organizing a summer camp.</p>
        <p>Before he left the language course at the university, we gathered with several friends — including our teacher — and went to Haidilao for a hotpot dinner.</p>

<section id="howtostart">
    <h1>How do I start?</h1>
    <p>
        The way I started studying was by loading up Duolingo to get a first impression of the language.
        At the beginning, it felt quite simple. The app introduces users to
        <strong>Pinyin</strong> (<span lang="zh-Hans">拼音</span>, <em>pīnyīn</em>), the Romanization system for Chinese,
        alongside <strong>Hanzi</strong> (<span lang="zh-Hans">汉字</span>, <em>hànzì</em>), the Chinese characters.
        Unlike the Roman alphabet, Chinese characters represent <strong>meaning</strong> rather than sound.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        One important tip: commit early on to learning <strong>Hanzi</strong> while also practicing the pronunciation
        of <strong>Pinyin</strong>. This is crucial if you want to actually speak the language and not just read or write it.
        If you skip this step and try to fix your pronunciation later, it will almost certainly be much more difficult.
        A very useful resource I used is this interactive Pinyin chart:
    <a href="https://yoyochinese.com/chinese-learning-tools/Mandarin-Chinese-pronunciation-lesson/pinyin-chart-table"
           target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="font-style: italic; border-bottom: 1px solid var(--fg); color: var(--fg);">Yoyo Chinese – Chinese learning tools</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It’s also recommended to start understanding how Chinese characters are constructed early on.
        This makes it easier to recognize new characters, as many share common parts.
        Most characters consist of two components: one <strong>semantic (symbolic)</strong> component and one
        <strong>phonetic</strong> component.
    </p>
    <img src="{% static 'images/character-structures.jpg' %}" alt="chinese-structure">
    
    <h3>Example: Character Structure</h3>
    <p>
        For example, the character <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">姐</span></strong> (on the second row of the table below) consists of two parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Left: semantic component <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">女</span></strong>, meaning <em>female, woman</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Right: phonetic component <strong><span lang="zh-Hans">且</span></strong>, pronounced <em>qiě</em>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Together, the meaning of the character is <em>big sister</em>.</p>
    <p>
        Some characters consist of three components (as shown in the 4th and 5th rows of the table below).
        Others are simple, single-component characters, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><span lang="zh-Hans">口</span></strong></li>
        <li><strong><span lang="zh-Hans">大</span></strong></li>
        <li><strong><span lang="zh-Hans">水</span></strong></li>
    </ul>
